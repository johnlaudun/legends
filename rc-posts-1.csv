Unlike the Moon, where you\'re partially shielded by Earth\'s magnetosphere, there\'s no such thing for Mars.

Like... why live on Mars? We evolved to live on Earth, or on an Earth-like planet. Why live on a lifeless, red rock, other than for bragging rights?

The jet fuel causing the beams to melt is definitely nonsense, because the huge explosions you see when the planes hit is basically all the jet fuel being strewn about and igniting. Sure some was left over, which sparked the office fires, but not even those could burn hot enough to melt steel into a liquid, let alone get that much steel hot enough to remain molten for weeks underneath the rubble. Those fires could’ve very well severely weakened some of the steel, and I could definitely see that causing the entire building from impact site upward to lean a lot or even lean far enough to severely damage and/or partially collapse that portion of the building.

Those planes and all the materials inside of them are not exactly that strong by themselves but accelerated it turns the plane into the same physics around penetration of materials in tanks. Accelerate anything to a high enough speed and the material is not important anymore, it's gonna penetrate the steel. \nSo you cut into the building, easily with only the first few cm of aircraft, and whats left is floor trusses, concrete which is way less dense than metal, wooden stuff human being and paper everywhere it's nothing compared to the plane, the plane enters further cutting apart the trusses on like 5 floors in the center of the building and the fuel is entirely burnt up with a factor of about 45 metrics tons of tnt, expands outwards with an explosion of around 4096000 m³ which also is in line with the math, 1 m³ of fuel ignited with take up 45000 m³ of space burning, and if u reduce it even more 1cm³ of fuel will burn and take up around 450cm³ of space around a pop bottle of space. So the fuel is burnt, the trusses are caving in with the weight of the floors displaced by 5 feet of missing support and that totals over 70000 metric tonnes of weight laying on top of a single floor area waiting to cave because vertically there is only the elevators and vents and all that, that cannot really hold the weight because it's fucking hollow and is only around 20% of the floor space the rest is holding 15966 metric tones of broken stuff and more weight is addrd from fire potentially breaking more things from above or maybe not, lying on a single floor.

I was taught that he would be a very popular and well liked individual; performing miracles and having great powers. Without the aid of technology, if a man could literally summon fire, raise the dead from the grave, or make the blind to see; wouldn\'t it be immediately obvious who he was? Being able to do ACTUAL magic would be a dead giveaway. It would be an open and shut case. A lot of the Bible is symbolic and speaks in metaphors. Especially the prophecies. Usually it\'s very cryptic and vague so they can be interpreted and applied in a variety of ways. What use would a hyper specific prophecy be? It either would probably be proven false or irrelevant since it was too specific. I think these miracles would be more nuanced and more in line with the definition of a ""modern miracle"".\n\nIf a woman recovers from stage 4 cancer it\'s a miracle. A man is in a car accident and told he will never walk again; yet 6 months later he is out of his wheelchair and walking, miracle. A popular Youtuber pays for 1000 blind people to see again? Miracle. While the people weren\'t completely blind, what he did could be considered a minor miracle. Buying houses for strangers, giving away lamborghinis, holding competitions to give away hundreds of thousands of dollars. All of which are miracles to the people receiving them. Nearly every video is him giving away ridiculous amounts of money. MrBeast is the most popular Youtuber of all time. In July 2016 he had 100,000 subscribers. Nobody has had such a rocket-like trajectory upwards so fast. He has the highest number of subscribers for an individual. Other channels have more but those are already established companies consisting of multitudes of people. How did he rise so quickly? Did he have supernatural help? Did the Devil help him to become so popular so fast?\n\nRevelation chapter 13:1-3 \'And I saw a beast coming out of the sea. It had ten horns and seven heads, with ten crowns on its horns, and on each head a blasphemous name. 2 The beast I saw resembled a leopard, but had feet like those of a bear and a mouth like that of a lion. The dragon(Satan) gave the beast his power and his throne and great authority.\' (Remember which animals, they return later)\n\nMrBeast\'s logo is a blue tiger which, depending on translation; could be interpreted as a lion or leopard. As for the 7 heads, I propose MrBeast and his 4 main friends who are featured in his videos could be the other heads. That\'s 5/7 so maybe the 2 remaining heads could be 2 who work anonymously or are 2 that are yet to come. The scripture mentions him rising out of the sea. As said before, the Bible is heavy on metaphors. He was born in Wichita, Kansas. While Wichita is nowhere near the sea, it is located in The Great Plains, a ""sea of grass"" and covers a larger area than the Mediterranean Sea. An actual sea. In addition, Wichita comes from a Choctaw Indian word that means “big arbor” or “big platform"". This platform was a mound of grass and wood historically used to pass along news or decrees from the chief of the tribe. The ""big platform"" could also apply to any medium which allows for having an important or influential voice. Youtube, Twitter, Facebook, or any other number of social media platforms.\n\nRevelations 13 also mentions a second beast that has the same authority as the first beast and sings the praises of the first beast. It also makes the people worship the beast. MrBeast\'s secondary channels combined are almost equal to his main channel. If anyone is subscribed to any of the alternate channels it\'s almost guaranteed they\'re subscribed to the main channel. His millions of followers are \'worshiping\' at the altar of The Beast. This beast is also the one that forces people to take on the mark of the beast on their right hand or forehead. This mark being the infamous 666. Again there being a physical mark is too literal of an application of the prophecy. This could be a sign that hasn\'t happened yet like the 2 heads of the first beast.\n\nDaniel 7 has a slightly different telling than Revelations. He describes 4 separate beasts. The first is a lion with wings of an eagle. It walks on 2 feet and is given the mind of a man. Secondly a bear with ribs in his mouth is told to \'Arise, devour much flesh\'. Thirdly, a leopard with 4 wings and 4 heads. The last beast is said to be \' terrifying and dreadful and exceedingly strong. It had great iron teeth; it devoured and broke in pieces and stamped what was left with its feet. And it had 10 horns.\' This prophecy separates many of the characteristics that were part of a single entity in Revelations. There are differences, but more alike than dissimilar. Between the 4 of them there are 10 horns, 7 heads, and the same animals spoke of in Revelations. Is the leopard with 4 heads and wings a representation of the 4 main crew members of MrBeast and is he the final beast with iron teeth? Who are the remaining 2? As with the Revelations prophecy it could be that it hasn\'t been fulfilled in full.\n\nThe most significant similarity between the prophecies are the 10 horns. Many think these horns are representations of 10 kingdoms or nation states, but in my opinion they are the kingdoms of MrBeast. Currently there are 6 Youtube channels and 2 startup companies that are under his control, MrBeast, Beast Philanthropy, MrBeast Gaming, Beast Reacts, MrBeast2 and lastly Don\'t Subscribe.

They program it into our subconscious minds. They tell us but the majority of us are still asleep. The owner sold it like a month before it happened, then cashed out on the insurance for millions more. It created fear of middle easterners, which in turn, if i was in charge of a country full of people that hated middle easterners and i said “Do y’all want to go to war with the Middle East?” The country would uprise. Hence GLOBAL WAR ON TERRORISM. We the people, the small guys, the middle man, we are not each others enemies. We all have one enemy and that’s the corrupt, evil, elites. There is so much that goes into it. Again (how i said they tell us through subconscious programming) watch the Simpsons (dome episode), then watch the Divergent series movies (they are against each other, DIVIDED into different “groups/cultures”) inside of a dome, then watch the hunger games, SAME CONCEPT, a fucked up country ran by evil, corrupt, evil mfs, the hunger games take place INSIDE OF A DOME…there is evidence of maps existing back to the 1700s of earth being flat (not saying that’s what i believe because it’s not, but I’m also not saying that i don’t believe, I’m open to suggestions, im open to anything, i just want to know the truth) but there is so many things the governments hide from us, there’s so much more going on, celebrities and Hollywood “idols” Have openly displayed their praise to Satan. Epstein’s island was for celebrities to rape, torture, and kill children…they hunt kidnapped children in Bohemian Grove. None of the people on his flight list have been killed, captured, or imprisoned…Kyle rittenhouse was on every. Single. Tv. At the same exact time ghislane maxwells trial was airing.

And for all of the people who say or ask “wHy WoUlD yOuR aMaZiNg GoD aLlOw ThEsE bAd ThInGs To HaPpEn?!” EVERYTIME SOMETHING BAD HAPPENS, you IMMEDIATELY BLAME IT ON GOD. While at the same time forgetting that Satan is the dark prince of Earth. God can only protect someone so much but EVIL is bound to happen. God can protect his people, but if someone who doesn’t believe in God or believes in Satan, God can’t do anything about those people except do his best at protecting his children only, GODS CHILDREN. Atheists and other religions give us so much hate…why does it make people SO UPSET AND ANGRY that we care and are spreading love and trying to save as many people as we can? If we didn’t care or didn’t ACTIVELY try to live by God’s word, we wouldn’t preach about it and we wouldn’t try getting others to believe. But that’s not what we do. That’s not the case. Now by all means, I’m not crazy at all, this is simply something i am very passionate about. I will never turn away from God, I’ve been able to see behind the lines of what the ones in power are doing, we are a joke to them, their goal is to have one government, one population, one money system, one “god” (Satan, which will never happen), one ruling system…we used to say the pledge of allegiance every morning in school. (They take God out of our lives) we used to have actual healthy, strong bonded families (almost every family is broken up and split nowadays, marriages don’t last, kids are taken from one another) we used to do the right thing when no one was looking (now it’s only cool when you post it online to get clout for “helping a homeless man”) we used to put God first and respect our friends, families, and neighbors…we used to come together in our communities and help people if they needed it…now it’s just trillions and billions of dollars to ukraine while our country is coming to its rapid downfall. Our prices are skyrocketing, our values and morals are deteriorating, women sell their bodies on onlyfans all the time now (in the Bible it says there are a few DEADLY sins that will send you to hell, one of them is sexual immorality, and the reasoning for this is because when you believe in God, and allow him into your life, the Holy Spirit lives inside of your body, so by committing any sin of sexual immorality, you’re also committing it against the Holy Spirit.) Just because you say you believe in God doesn’t automatically save you, you have to not only believe, but then also try your hardest to follow the standard that JESUS set when he was here on earth. Sin free and FULL OF LOVE. I hope this helps at least 1 person on this thread.

But even without religion being involved, if you choose to do any of that, that says a whole lot more about you and who you are as a person than it does me. My point is this…the WTC was not an attack, it was a inside Job from our government and a insider hijacking. The attack against our own people, on our own soil, was never a terrorist attack, it was a planned piece in a huge game. The sooner more people realize this, and realize just how evil and corrupt the “elite” actually are, the sooner people MAYBE might actually try to save their own lives and repent to Jesus.

Long but extremely informative and necessary to understand who runs the world, why Trump, Clintons, Biden are puppets, and why Putin and Zelensky are puppets of the Rothschild NWO Banking Cartel. Modern Ukraine formed in 1917 by Rothschilds",112,13o4een,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/13o4een/how_the_rothschilds_took_over_the_world_by/,37,"Amschel Moses Rothschild was born in about 1710. He was a German Jewish silk trader and money changer in the Judengasse (Jewstreet) in Frankfurt. Around 1743 he placed a red hexagram sign (which numerically and geometrically convert into the number 666) above the entrance of his door. His house was also red in color. 

Within two centuries, the Rothschild, instructed this hexagram sign to be made part of the Israeli flag 🇮🇱. He had 8 children with Schönche Lechnich, one of his sons, Mayer Amschel Rothschild (1744-1812), is the founder of the Rothschild banking dynasty. He marries Guttle Schnapper/Schönche Lechnich (Rothschild) in 1770, and they have 10 children together. 

Around 1760, Mayer Amschel Bauer worked for a bank owned by the Oppenheimer (are part of Rothschild family/married, had children together..). Mayer was very successful and became a junior partner, where he meets General von Estorff.

After Mayer Amschel Bauer’s father Moses Amschel Bauer died, Mayer changed his name from Bauer to Rothschild (Rot = red / Schild = sign).

Mayer Amschel Rothschild and his sons establish what was known as the Five Arrows of Banking. These golden arrows can be seen on the eagle’s talons visible on the coat of arms city from Frankfurt, Germany. It represented the 5 sons who managed the global banking Houses of the Rothschild which included:

• Frankfurt • London • Paris • Vienna • Napl 

Mayer discovers that General von Estorff is aquatinted with the court of Prince William IX, Landgrave of Hesse-Hanau (known today as Hesse-Kassel) (married?). The royal house of William obtained its’ wealth by the hiring out or exporting their soldiers to foreign countries for major profit. 

Mayer began selling William IX rare trinkets, treasures, and coins at extra low prices. Eventually, as planned, Mayer is introduced to the Prince himself, who is delighted with the modified prices. Mayer even offers the prince a perk for any new business opportunities, William could direct his way. As a result, Mayer Amschel Rothschild and Prince William join forces and become business accomplices. 

In 1769, Prince William grants Mayer approval to hang a sign on his business storefront declaring that he is, “M. A. Rothschild, by appointment court factor to his serene highness, Prince William of Hanau.” 

In 1773, Amschel Mayer Rothschild is born, eventually he would take over the Frankfurt bank. He is the first of Mayer’s sons who will all eventually enter the family business at 12 years of age. He is followed by Salomon Mayer Rothschild, in 1774.

In 1776, Mayer Amschel Rothschild creates the Illuminati and hands over the organizations development to Adam Weishaupt. Weishaupt sneaks in the Continental Order of Freemasons with this Illuminati doctrine. This doctrine claims a new order for the human race under the dictatorship of Satan and his supporters. This view is accepted and spread like a wildfire and is pursued in Masonic Lodges worldwide to this day.

In 1777, Nathan Mayer Rothschild is born, who is followed by Kalmann (Carl) Mayer Rothschild/Carl Mayer Freiherr von Rothschild in 1788. Carl is the founder of the Rothschild banking family of Naples. He had child named Adolf Carl....

In 1791, Alexander Hamilton, (a Rothschild representative in George Washington’s cabinet) and the Rothschilds, infiltrated a central bank in the newly established United States colonies. This bank was know as the Bank of the United States and was organized with a 20 year charter.

“Jacob” or “James” Mayer de Rothschild or Baron de Rothschild is born in 1792. Originally named Jakob Mayer Rothschild. He is the youngest child of Mayer. He was a German-French banker and is the founder of the French banking branch of the Rothschild family. He had 5 children. 

Amschel Mayer Rothschild marries Eva Hanau in 1796. 

In 1798, Mayer, grants his son, Nathan Mayer Rothschild, a major sum of money, and sends him to England, to advance the family interests in importing textile. This allowed him to establish a bank in the City of London known as N. M. Rothschild & Sons.

In 1806, Prince William, escapes Germany and assigns his $3,000,000 fortune over to Mayer Amschel Rothschild for guardianship, because Napoleon made it his objective to abolish the rulership and influence of the house of Hess-Cassel.

Nathan Mayer also marries Rothschild Hannah Barent Cohen during this time. 

In 1808, Nathan Mayer Rothschild has his first child, Lionel Nathan de Rothschild.

In 1810, Mayer entered into a formal partnership agreement with his three eldest sons. Abraham Goldsmid and Sir Francis Baring die, leaving Nathan Mayer Rothschild as the last major remaining banker in England.

Salomon Mayer Rothschild launches the bank, M. von Rothschild und Söhne in Vienna, Austria. And Calmann (""Carl"") established the branch in Naples, Italy.

The youngest son Jacob, was sent to Paris in 1811, strengthening the family's ability to operate across Europe by opening the bank “de Rothschild Frères. This allowed them to profit by funding the Wellington's armies in Portugal, which required them to secure large quantities of gold in favor of the British government.

The charter established between the Rothschild and the Bank of the United States in 1791 runs out in 1811 and Congress decided to vote against its renewal. 

Andrew Jackson (7th President of the U.S. from 1829 to 1837) stated, “If Congress has a right under the Constitution to issue paper money, it was given them to use by themselves, not to be delegated to individuals or corporations.”

Nathan Mayer Rothschild replied, “Either the application for renewal of the charter is granted, or the United States will find itself involved in a most disastrous war.” 

In 1812, Britain, which was supported by the Rothschild empire, declared war on the United States. The Rothschilds systematically arranged this war to cause the United States to build up a major debt due to them defending themselves. Eventually, they would have to surrender which forced them to renew the charter for the Rothschild owned Bank of the United States.

Mayer Amschel Rothschild perishes. In his will, he establishes very specific rules that the Rothschild must obey: 

• All major positions in the family business may only be held by family members; specifically only male members, which included a rumored sixth bastard son. (Mayer Amschel also had five daughters. Their Zionist empire also included mixed offspring of Jewish decent.) • In order to preserve their fortune they had to intermarry with their first and second cousins (16 of the 18 marriages between Mayers’ grandchildren were between first cousins). • No publication of their estates or inventory • no legal action was to be taken with respect to the value of their fortune • The oldest son of the oldest son was to become the head of the family, but this could be reversed if the bulk of the family decided otherwise. 

The $3,000,000 entrusted to Mayer by Prince William is accounted for in the Jewish Encyclopaedia, 1905 edition, Volume 10, page 494, which states, “According to legend this money was hidden away in wine casks, and, escaping the search of Napoleon’s soldiers when they entered Frankfurt, was restored intact in the same casks in 1814, when the elector (Prince William IX of Hesse-Hanau) returned to the electorate (Germany). The facts are somewhat less romantic, and more businesslike.”

The money was never truly “returned” by Rothschild to Prince William, instead their families married each other for business purposes, to keep the money hidden and allowing both families to gain and grow the empire. The encyclopaedia also states, “Nathan Mayer Rothschild invested this $3,000,000 in, gold from the East India Company knowing that it would be needed for Wellington’s peninsula campaign.” The Rothschilds made, “no less than four profits: 1. i) On the sale of Wellington’s paper which he bought at 50 cents on the dollar and collected at par; 2. ii) on the sale of gold to Wellington; 3. iii) on its repurchase; and 4. iv) on forwarding it to Portugal.”

In 1815, the Rothschild brothers started their policy of financing both sides of the wars by the suppling them with gold Wellington’s army (Nathan in England) and Napoleon’s army (Jacob in France).

Since these brothers had banks spread out across Europe, it allowed them to set up an unmatched postal service grid of secret routes and couriers allowing them to be one step ahead of the crowd.

These couriers were the only ones allowed to pass through the French and English blockades, which then reported back to Nathan and kept him up to date with how the war was going allowing him to buy/sell stock successfully. 

When the war ended and the British defeated Napoleon, Nathan, through past strategic planning made a return of 20:1 on his investments, which gave the Rothschilds complete control over the British economy forcing England to establish a different Bank of England, which Nathan controlled. He would later state, 

“I care not what puppet is placed upon the throne of England to rule the Empire on which the sun never sets. The man who controls Britain’s money supply controls the British Empire, and I control the British money supply.”

The newly established Bank of England controlled by the Rothschilds changed their approach of shipping gold to different countries by using their five banks across Europe to set up a banking system of paper credits and, which is still used today.

In 1816, the Rothschild’s charter for the Bank of the United States was renewed for twenty more years giving the Rothschilds full control of the American money supply once again. 

After the French’s defeat at Waterloo, the French attained major loans in 1817 to rebuild themselves. 

In 1818, the Rothschilds, bought large amounts of French government bonds allowing them to take control of the French money supply. They also loaned the Prussian government £5,000,000.

In the year 1821, Kalmann (Carl Mayer Rothschild), was sent to Naples, Italy. There he conducted many business deals with Pope Gregory XVI and the Vatican, eventually coming up with the Order of St. George.

By 1823, the Rothschild empire has gained complete financial control over the Catholic Church operations, globally.

In 1827, Sir Walter Scott, published a nine volume set book series. In volume two he writes that the French Revolution was prepared by Adam Weishaipt’s Illuminati and funded by the Rothschilds’ European banking empire.

In 1835, the 7th president of the United States, Andrew Jackson, began placing the federal funds into banks managed by democratic bankers instead of the Rothschild governed Bank of the United States.

This lead to an assassination attempt being made on President Jackson, who would later declare that he knew the Rothschilds were at fault for the assassination attempt.

The Rothschilds gained ownership over the Almadén quicksilver mines in Spain. This was important, because quicksilver was a critical factor in the refining of gold or silver. This established a basic world monopoly for the Rothschild banking empire.

Nathan Mayer Rothschild dies in 1836. and his bank, N. M. Rothschild & Sons is taken over by his younger brother, James Mayer Rothschild.

In the year 1837, President Andrew Jackson succeeds in overthrowing the Rothschild controlled Bank of America. It wouldn’t be until the year 1913 that the Rothschilds could reestablish their third central bank in America, the (illegal) Federal Reserve.

In 1838, Amschel Mayer Rothschild declares, “Permit me to issue and control the money of a nation, and I care not who makes its laws.”

In 1840, the Rothschilds become stock brokers of the Bank of England. This allows them to set up agencies in Australia and California. 

In 1844, Salomon Mayer Rothschild, buys the United Coal Mines of Vítkovice and a Hungarian Blast Furnace Company. 

Jacob (James) Mayer Rothschild/Baron James de Rothschild, married his niece, Betty, who is the daughter of his brother Salomon Mayer Rothschild. James wins a deal allowing him to assemble the first major railroad line called the Chemin De Fer Du Nord, which ran from Paris to Valenciennes. Eventually this railway would join together with the Austrian rail-system built by his brother Salomon Mayer Rothschild.

In 1858, Lionel De Rothschild takes his seat in the British parliament making him the first Jewish member. 

In 1861, the 16th President of the United States, Abraham Lincoln (1860-1865) secures loans through the Rothschilds to fund the American civil war via Charters, but these loans came at high interest rates (between 24% -36%).

So, Lincoln decided to print his own money, which was debt free and could be legally used in private and public debts/affairs. By April 1862, $449,338,902 of the debt free money Lincoln created was distributed.

In 1863, Italy, unifies causing the (Carl) Rothschild bank in Naples, Italy, to close. So the Rothschilds decided they would use their American assistant, John D. Rockefeller, to help establish an oil business also known as Standard Oil, who became the leader in the industry. 

Alexander II (1855 – 1881), Tsar of Russia, also had issues with the Rothschilds, because he refused to let them set up a central bank in Russia. In 1864, Abraham Lincoln discovers this feud and request Tsar to help fund the Civil War. Tsar agrees and sends part of his navy to the coast of New York and California. Allowing Lincoln to win the Civil War.

In 1865, President Lincoln states in a statement to Congress, “I have two great enemies, the Southern Army in front of me, and the financial institution in the rear. Of the two, the one in my rear is my greatest foe.”

President Lincoln is assassinated later that year (1865).

Otto von Bismarck states in 1876, “The division of the United States into two federations of equal force was decided long before the civil war by the high financial power of Europe.These bankers were afraid that the United States, if they remained in one block and as one nation, would attain economical and financial independence, which would upset their financial domination over the world. The voice of the Rothschilds predominated. They foresaw the tremendous booty if they could substitute two feeble democracies, indebted to the financiers, to the vigorous Republic, confident and self-providing. Therefore they started their emissaries in order to exploit the question of slavery and thus dig an abyss between the two parts of the Republic.”

The 20th President of the United States, James A. Garfield (lasted only 100 Days) stated two weeks before he was assassinated in 1881, “Whoever controls the volume of money in our country is absolute master of all industry and commerce…and when you realize that the entire system is very easily controlled, one way or another, by a few powerful men at the top, you will not have to be told how periods of inflation and depression originate.”

Edmond James de Rothschild has a son named Maurice de Rothschild. (Adolf Hitler is really Maurice de Rothschild with fake beard and hair piece and carries out his father’s (Baron Abraham Edmond Benjamin James de Rothschild 1845 –1934) work. Since the war caused a sugar shortage, Maurice would have also been the candy man aka Willy Wanka and his top hat 🎩 and cain in his photos match the part).

In 1886, The French Rothschild bank, de Rothschild Frères, gains the Russian oil fields and establishes the Caspian and Black Sea Petroleum Company, which eventually becomes second largest global oil producer.

The Rothschilds become the biggest shareholder of the De Beers company in 1887, which included mining valuable stones in India and Africa. They achieved this by financing the South Africa’s Kimberley diamond mines.

Maurice de Rothschild’s future wife, Noémie Halphen, is born in 1888.

Around 1891, the Rothschilds they purchased the Reuters news agency, to gain control of the media.

In 1895, Edmond James de Rothschild visits Palestine and begins helping fund the first Jewish colonies located there.

In 1897, The Rothschilds organize their first meeting with the Zionist Congress in Munich. However, this meeting was re-arranged to take place in Basle, Switzerland on Aug. 29th, due to Jewish resistance. This meeting is supervised by Theodor Herzl, who would declare in his diaries, “It is essential that the sufferings of Jews….become worse….this will assist in realization of our plans….I have an excellent idea….I shall induce anti-Semites to liquidate Jewish wealth….The anti-Semites will assist us thereby in that they will strengthen the persecution and oppression of Jews. The anti-Semites shall be our best friends.”

Herzl was elected to be the President of the Zionist Organization. The Zionist society adopted the Red Rothschild Hexagram Sign that Amschel Moses Rothschild placed on his house on Judengasse (Jewstreet), on their Zionist flag. This hexagram sign would end up on the flag of Israel 🇮🇱 51 years later.

The Rothschilds help fund Edward Henry Harriman. This allowed him to become the director of the Union Pacific Railroad which would eventually also gain control of the Southern Pacific Railroad.

In 1901 the Jewish colonies established by Edmond James de Rothschild in Palestine. They send him a delegation which states, “If you wish to save the Yishuv (The Jewish colonies) first take your hands from it, and…for once permit the colonists to have the possibility of correcting for themselves what needs correcting.”

Edmond James de Rothschild does not react very well to these news and states, “I created the Yishuv, I alone. Therefore no men, neither colonists nor organisations have the right to interfere in my plans.”

The M. A. von Rothschild und Söhne banking house in Frankfurt, Deutschland 🇩🇪, closes because there was no male Rothschild heir to take over the bank.

The Jewish Encyclopaedia (Vol. 2, p.497) states, “It is a somewhat curious sequel to the attempt to set up a Catholic competitor to the Rothschilds that at the present time the latter are the guardians of the papal treasure.”

In 1906, the Rothschilds insisted that the land was experiencing increased instability, while the Rockefellers were simultaneously￼ becoming a rising competition. This was a lie, because in reality, the Rockefellers were the offspring of the Rothschilds through a female lineage. They owned Standard Oil, which is why they sold their Caspian Black Sea and Caspian Petroleum to Shell and Royal Dutch.

John F. Hylan, then mayor of New York, states in 1911, “The real menace of our republic is the invisible government which, like a giant octopus, sprawls its slimy length over our city, state and nation. At the head is a small group of banking houses, generally referred to as international bankers.”

George R. Conroy talks about the Rothschild banker Jacob Schiff in the December 1912 issue of, “Truth,” magazine, and states, “Mr Schiff is head of the great private banking house of Kuhn, Loeb, and co, which represents the Rothschilds interests on this side of the Atlantic. He has been described as financial strategist and has been for years the financial minister of the great impersonal power known as Standard Oil. He was hand in glove with the Harrimans, the Goulds, and the Rockefellers in all their railroad enterprises and has become the dominant power in the railroad and financial power of America.”

The Anti Defamation League (ADL) is established in the United States by the Rothschilds in 1913, which labeled anyone who challenged the Global Elite as “anti-Semitic.” This is also the year that they founded their last central bank which still exists today, the Federal Reserve. 

After the Federal Reserve Act of 1913 was passed/singed into law on December 23, by the 28th President of the United States, Woodrow Wilson, which created the Federal Reserve Banking System, Congressman Charles Lindbergh, stated, “The Act establishes the most gigantic trust on earth. When the President signs this Bill, the invisible government of the monetary power will be legalized…….The greatest crime of the ages is perpetrated by this banking and currency bill.”

**The Federal Reserve System is a private Organization also known as a charity and is Illegal!!! They also do not publish their accounts**\*

By the year 1914 the Rothschilds have gained control of multiple European media agencies, which included, Havas (est. 1835) in France, Wolff (est. 1849) in Germany, and Reuters (est. 1851) in England. Wolff News company was used to systematically shape German individuals into believing war the way to go. Since the Rothschilds owned the media now, they were seldomly reported on.

Since, Tsar Alexander II choose to side with President Lincoln in the Cvil War in 1864, he and his whole family in Russia were executed in 1917 by an order of the Rothschilds. They kill the entire family to show the world what happens when you try to cross them. 

In 1919, Baron Edmond de Rothschild, the boss, hosted the Versailles peace convention, which meets after the end of World War I to determine what must be repaid by the Germans to the victors. In this conference, it is also officially declared that Israel would be considered a Jewish homeland. Control of Palestine was handed to Britain, which the Rothschilds ruled.

The Times of London report on March 29th on the Bolsheviks in Russia stating, “One of the curious features of the Bolshevist movement is the high percentage of non Russian elements among its leaders. Of the twenty or thirty commissaries, or leaders, who provide the central machinery of the Bolshevist movement, not less than 75% were Jews.”

The Rothschilds were not happy with the Russians because they did not want them to establish their own central bank within their community. So they hired Jewish agents to spy on Russia and plant seeds in the heads of the Russian community about a revolution that would assist the common man by promoting rebellion through riots. The Rothschilds strategically set this up to conquer￼ Russia, so they could establish their own bank there.

The International Edition of the Jewish Post (January 1991)verifies that Vladimir Lenin was Jewish and was caught on record declaring, “The establishment of a central bank is 90% of communizing a nation.”

These Jewish Bolsheviks, funded by the Rothschild would end up would end up slaughtering 60 million Non-Jews and Christians in a Soviet controlled region.

Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, an author, confirms in his writings, “Gulag Archipelago, Vol 2,” that the Zionist Jews planned and executed the Soviet concentration camp structure. Where millions of Non-Jews and Christians died. On page 79 of his book he mentions the names of the leaders who were behind these camps. This included the Zionist Jews, Yakov Rappoport, Aron Solts, Naftaly Frenkel, Lazar Kogan, Genrikh Yagoda, and Matvei Berman. 

The role of adjusting the daily global gold prices is permanently handed over to M. Rothschild & Sons’. Every day around 1100 hours this change took place in the City of London offices, in the same room, until 2004.

N. M. Rothschild & Sons banking house invests in the Underground Electric Railways Company of London Ltd in 1926 giving them total control of the London railway transport system.

Maurice de Rothschild son, Edmond de Rothschild is also born in 1926.

By 1933, the Rothschilds controlled the supply machines of IBM, which produced punch cards (used to input data into the first computers), which allowed the Nazis to organize and identify the Jewish individuals and kept track of their confiscated property and eventual extermination.

The Swiss bank secrecy laws are altered in 1934, making it a violation for any bank employee to breach the bank secrecy. This was arranged by the Rothschilds to prepare for World War II, where again, they would back both sides.

The Austrian bank in Vienna, S. M. von Rothschild und Söhne, closed in 1938 after the Nazi settlement of Austria.

The biggest producer of steel Germany and preeminent manufacturer of chemicals for the world was a company called, I.G. Farben, who in 1939, suddenly ramped up its production in order to equip Germany for World War II. The Rothschilds controlled I.G. Farben, who also produced the Zyklon B gas used to exterminate the Jewish population. The Rothschilds also used the Jews and other people in the concentration camps for slave labor. 

World War II begins in 1939.

The book, “Inside The Gestapo,” written by Hansjurgen Koehler in 1940, mentions Adolf Hitler’s grandmother, Maria Anna Schicklgruber, and states, “A little servant girl…….came to Vienna and became a domestic servant…….at the Rothschild mansion…….and Hitler’s unknown grandfather must be probably looked for in this magnificent house.”

In Walter Langer book, “The Mind Of Hitler,” he supports this statement by writing, “Adolf’s father, Alois Hitler, was the illegitimate son of Maria Anna Schicklgruber…….Maria Anna Schicklgruber was living in Vienna at the time she conceived. At that time she was employed as a servant in the home of Baron Rothschild. As soon as the family discovered her pregnancy she was sent back home…….where Alois was born.”

Prescott Bush was the father of George Herbert Walker Bush and the grandfather of George W. Bush, both future presidents. He helped finance Hitler from America. Due to his funding, his organization was seized in the, “Trading With The Enemy Act of 1942.”

World War II ends in 1945. It is also noted that the I.G. Farben companies only sustained 15% damage, concluding that they were not a target in the bombing of Germany. Any information connecting Western aid to Hitler is censored through the Nazi War Crimes investigation held at the end of World War II by the tribunals. 

In Spring of 1948, the 33rd President of the United States Harry S. Truman (1945 – 1953) is bribed with $2,000,000 by the Rothschilds to acknowledge Israel (Rothschild owned) as a Jewish sovereign state in Palestine. The United States is the first nation to recognize it and the new flag is soon revealed. The new Israel flag depicted a blue hexagram on it, which was exactly like the red Rothschild hexagram, found on Amschel Moses Rothschild’s doorstep. 

The Jewish knew the hexagram represented the “Moloch,” which was the biblical name of a Canaanite god relating to child sacrifice, by means of fire or war. The stone owl located at the Bohemian Grove worshipped by the elite is also named Moloch and Astaroth (Lord Treasurer of Hell). The hexagram also symbolized Saturn, which has been identified as the mystical name for “Satan.” This would mean that anyone murdered in the name of Israel was in reality an offering to Satan.

In 1953, the British Newfoundland Corporation Ltd was founded by N. M. Rothschild & Sons of London. They build a power plant to harness the electricity of the Hamilton (renamed Churchill) Falls (waterfall) on 60,000 square miles of terrain in Newfoundland, Canada.

Edmond de Rothschild established Compagnie Financiere, Paris, in 1955.

In the year 1962, the French banking house, de Rothschild Frères, founded Imétal, a shade company for all their mineral excavating shares.

A book called, “The Rothschilds”, written by Frederic Morton writes, “Though they control scores of industrial, commercial, mining and tourist corporations, not one bears the name Rothschild. Being private partnerships, the family houses never need to, and never do, publish a single public balance sheet, or any other report of their financial condition.”

This statement showcases the true mission of the Rothschilds.  
 It was their objective to eradicate all competition and establish their own global monopoly.

On July 4th 1962, the 35th President of the United States, John F. Kennedy, held a speech at Independence Hall, in which he mocked the Declaration of Independence and states that the Constitution, “stressed not Independence but Interdependence.” 

On June 4th 1963, the 35th President of the United States, John F. Kennedy, issues the Executive Order 11110, which returned the power to distribute currency back to the U.S. government, without having to go through the Federal Reserve possessed by the Rothschilds.

On November 22nd 1963, Kennedy was shot by the Rothschilds. Kennedy’s motive was to distribute and print American currency for the American people. Abraham Lincoln was assassinated for the same reason in 1865 by the Rothschilds. 

The 37th President of the United States, Lyndon Baines Johnson, declares the Executive Order 11110 as void, the same day that Kennedy was killed.

La Compagnie Financière Edmond de Rothschild (LCF), in Switzerland, an investment bank with many associates is established by Edmond de Rothschild. Today, this bank is known as the Swiss Bank. Edmond marries Nadine and have a son together named, Benjamin de Rothschild.

In 1973, Gary Allen, wrote a book called, None Dare Call It Conspiracy, which states, “One major reason for the historical blackout on the role of the international bankers in political history is the Rothschilds were Jewish… ….The Jewish members of the conspiracy have used an organisation called The Anti-Defamation League (ADL) as an instrument to try and convince everyone that any mention of the Rothschilds and their allies is an attack on all Jews. In this way they have stifled almost all honest scholarship on international bankers and made the subject taboo within universities. Any individual or book exploring this subject is immediately attacked by hundreds of ADL communities all over the country. The ADL has never let the truth or logic interfere with its highly professional smear jobs… ….Actually, nobody has a right to be more angry at the Rothschild clique than their fellow Jews… ….The Rothschild empire helped finance Adolf Hitler.”

IBM was controlled by the Rothschilds through their employee, George J. Laurer. IBM creates the UPC (Universal Product Code) barcode, which is placed upon every product traded worldwide. IBM’s UPC barcode bears the mark of the beast, 666. Everything bought or sold is therefore the mark of the beast.

The Book of Revelation 13:17 says, “No man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name.”

The Churchill Falls power plant in Newfoundland, Canada, is finished. N. M. Rothschild & Sons of London, adds an asset management company, called the Rothschild Private Management Limited, which traded globally. Today this company is know as Rothschild & Co.

In 1980, global privatization starts due to the Rothschilds plan to eventually seize power of all publicly held assets.

In 1981, a new bank called, Compagnie Européenne de Banque is established in France. The successor to this bank is Rothschild & Cie Banque (RCB), which eventually becomes a leading French investment company.

Eustace Mullins writes in 1985, “Who Owns The TV Networks,“ where he discloses that the Rothschilds control of the three dominant U.S. Networks at the time: NBC; CBS; and ABC.

Edmond de Rothschild sets up the World Conservation Bank in 1987, which transferred debts from third world countries into his bank. This allowed the Rothschilds to gain land as a return from these countries. The Rothschilds systematically designed this system to gain control of the third world countries, which were about 30% of the land on Earth.

The French and British Rothschilds declare in 1989, the launch of a new branch called, Rothschild GmbH, located in Frankfurt, Germany.

Former Federal Reserve Board Chairman, Paul A. Volker becomes the new Chairman of the banking firm, J. Rothschild, Wolfensohn and Co. in Europe in March 1992.

In 1995, Dr Kitty Little, a past atomic energy scientist, stated that the Rothschilds now possessed 80% of the uranium supplies globally, creating their nuclear power monopoly.

The European Central Bank is established in 1998 and is located in Frankfurt, Germany.

George W. Bush, becomes the 43rd President of the United States in the year 2000. Bush and his family declare they are the ancestors of the House of Plantagenet, whose linage stems from the Royal House of Judah.

The September 11th attack of the Twin Towers was arranged by the United States, Britain, and Israel, through an order received from the Rothschilds. It was their goal to gain security and control over the world, while simultaneously eliminating the liberty of people globally. The Rothschild’s terrorist attack allowed them to gain power over nations who refused to build a central Rothschild bank. One of these 7 nations was Afghanistan, (at the time a nation without R. Bank, but 9/11 changed this.)

They also will use the attacks to gain control of the few nations in the world who don’t allow Rothschild central banks and so less than one month after these attacks, US forces attack Afghanistan, one of only 7 nations in the world who don’t have a Rothschild controlled central bank.

A week before the twin tower attack, the Zim Shipping Company, located in the World Trade Centers, break their lease and leave behind their work station. No explanation has been given, but it is know that the Zim Shipping Company is half owned by the State of Israel, which is owned by The Rothschilds.

In the year 2003, Iraq (Ancient Babylon), is one of the last six nations left that who don’t have a central bank owned by the Rothschilds. The war in Iraq was mostly about robbing their water sources for Israel. Israel has always struggled for water. Water is rare in Israel, so to them water is far more valuable than the oil reserves, which happen to be the second largest oil reserves on the globe. 

In 2006, the Edmond De Rothschild Banque a secondary branch of the Edmond De Rothschild bank in France, is the first foreign bank to acquire authorization of the China to enter China’s economic market.",1684698497.0,"['###[Meta] Sticky Comment\n\n[Rule 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/wiki/faq#wiki_2_-_address_the_argument.3B_not_the_user.2C_the_mods.2C_or_the_sub.) ***does not apply*** when replying to this stickied comment.  \n\n[Rule 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/wiki/faq#wiki_2_-_address_the_argument.3B_not_the_user.2C_the_mods.2C_or_the_sub.) ***does apply*** throughout the rest of this thread.\n\n*What this means*: Please keep any ""meta"" discussion directed at specific users, mods, or /r/conspiracy in general in this comment chain ***only.***\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

46,Idaho Student Murders,0,13or6it,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/13or6it/idaho_student_murders/,2,"I am hearing this new information about the suspect in the Idaho murders. 

The story says that around the same time frame as the Idaho crime, he allegedly broke into a neighbor woman's apartment in Pullman. He apparently just moved things around. This of course frightened the woman when she discovered the break in. She calls her friendly neighbor to help her, not realizing that he is the person that broke in. 

So this suspect helps the woman set up a surveillance camera in her house so she can catch the ""intruder"" the next time he strikes. In so doing, the suspect obtains this woman's wi-fi password. He then uses his access to her system to spy on her through the camera while she goes about her life. This is obviously very much a crime and she of course has absolutely no idea this is going on.

So this is the same MO as what he seems to have been doing in Idaho. For starters, it's pretty clear this guy is a voyeur. He is the type that would use hidden cameras, that sort of thing. But how convenient is it if you have wi-fi access the cameras that are already in the house? 

Any way, my new theory is that somehow this suspect got the wi-fi password for King Road. And, he started using it the same way he spied on his neighbor: by connecting to it from nearby. A great place to park your car would be right here:

You could remain parked there as long as you want, because it is the lot for the apartment next door. But, it's close enough that you can still get on 1122 King Road wi-fi from inside your car. Which is what I think this suspect was doing. He had been ""in"" the house several times. Literally as well as virtually. He could have been watching them through their own cameras when he decided the time was right to strike. He was steps away.

Knowing that my internet, location, and relationship (phones that appear near mine frequently) data is harvested, commoditized, and used to sell products to me, I am very curious why a diamond ring would be an appropriate advertisement for me. 

My friend group is between strollers and colleges, having left the diamond ring stage well over a decade ago. I have not been in jewelry store in years. If I were to search for rings online to surprise my spouse, I certainly would at least use a private browser considering how data is stored on computers, routers, etc. 

There is only one logical conclusion as to why I would have received a diamond ring advertisement this morning:

*Last week I discussed with a friend how I would NEVER buy a mined diamond due to them possessing no inherent value and the unethical treatment of the diamond mine laborers. I specifically stated they only way I would buy a diamond is if it was lab grown.*

The diamond ring advertisement this morning was Brilliant Earth.

Its extreme nationalism originated in pan-Germanism and the ethno-nationalist neopagan Völkisch movement which had been a prominent aspect of German ultranationalism since the late 19th century, and it was strongly influenced by the Freikorps paramilitary groups that emerged after Germany\'s defeat in World War I, from which came the party\'s underlying ""cult of violence"".

It sought to overcome social divisions and create a homogeneous German society based on racial purity which represented a people\'s community (Volksgemeinschaft).

Not so much incapable, it is just unnecessary, a trivial “Human” problem, all potential outcomes have been seen & are known.

You shall not make for yourself a graven image, nor any manner of likeness of anything that is in heaven above, that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth. You shall not bow down to them, nor serve them. For I the L‑rd your G‑d am a jealous G‑d, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children of the third and fourth generation of them that hate Me; and showing mercy unto the thousandth generation of them that love Me and keep My commandments.”\n\nThe idea of “Jesus” & “The Trinity” is a direct violation of The Second Commandment. \n\nSo right off the bat, you have an Infallible, Omniscient & Omnipotent God who Either made a mistake, or changed“His” mind (Cognitive Dissonance is a VERY human trait). Add to it, that after the perfect & all powerful God needed to change “His” mind, “He” decided to disregard the Second (arguably the most important)Commandment by creating a Living Idol on Earth in “His” place, and by doing so, transgressed “His” own commandment, and set up his “New” chosen people for failure(if you take the Ten Commandments as concrete rule of divine law). \n\nI can go on indefinitely, but those two issues are blatant contradictions, & should probably be addressed before I continue."", 'I took a dump this morning and some black nuggets dropped and formed some floating black cubes 💯', ""That sounds amazing!! \n\nI don't think it would be the same in the United States, though.

I\'ll help you get started: NOTHING IN THE OLD TESTAMENT IS LAW ANYMORE. \n\nColossians 2:14. \nWhen Jesus died, he fulfilled the law, nailing it to the cross. Unless Jesus or the apostles in the bible repeated a command from God, it no longer is necessary to get to heaven.

Single payer may be cheaper than our current system, but it\'s definitely not the ""best"" solution.\n\nOne of the biggest reasons for our inefficiencies are incredibly expensive regulatory compliance costs levied on multiple levels. Hospitals, Doctors, Pharmacies, Pharmaceutical Companies, Medical equipment manufacturers, and Insurance companies all have an incredible amount of compliance cost that is automatically built into the price of the goods and services.\n\nAnother is the complete lack of transparency in the system. Nobody knows the cost of any medical procedure. It\'s all done through billing departments out of site of the consumer. The battle for payment between provider and insurer drives costs significantly. Without transparency to the consumer, and with the current necessity to have insurance, there is no incentive for the consumer to shop around for procedures.\n\nLack of competition also adds to the cost. This is mostly caused by cronyism between the government and the larger providers (Pharma, Hospitals, Insurance). Cronyism prevents would be competitors from entering the marketplace. If a private practice is fortunate enough to open, they typically cannot except most insurances, due to insufficient payment terms that cannot come close to paying for compliance costs, let alone other expenses.\n\nAnother big reason is the disastrous intellectual properties laws that we have. There is zero reason that a drug company should be able to leverage the same patent for 50+ years against competition. Of course this prevents the cost of drugs from falling as it would in a free market.\n\nIn my opinion, if we were to shift to a single payer system, those other issues will not go away. It will however, make cronyism easier and further eliminate any potential for market transparency. Prices will continue to rise as more people seek unneeded treatment, because it\'s now ""free"", causing tighter supply chains and less profitability for the service providers.\n\nThe real solution is the eliminate government involvement as much as possible and let the free market work.\n\n**TL:DR - Government involvement has forced healthcare out of the free market causing incredibly high costs.

It is a combination of carbs and fat, each of which are needed in a balanced diet. The problem arises when, in combination, they foster weight gain like few other things. Snack foods in general are high in flavor and low in nutritional value. Add all this to an increasingly lethargic lifestyle and health suffers. Yes, 'healthcare' in the US is insanely expensive. In the US, we consume more health related services because we require them, whether we can afford them or not. It's also a system that is very much 'charge all the traffic can bear', instead of providing the product at as low a price point as possible while maintaining quality. Government intervention isn't the answer, as that simply adds another layer of cost onto an already bloated system. The US has a large and growing subset of healthcare devoted to problems associated with being overweight. People spend billions each year on diet products and still get fatter. Most people know others who have mobility issues due to being too damned fat. Obesity is just one area of concern; there are many others. Another one is issues related to the abuse of drugs, both legal and illegal. Billions are also spent on this problem, and that abuse shortens average life span. Illegal drug use focuses on penalizing the providers of the illicit drugs, but what about the consumers? They make the choice to pop the pills, snort the blow, shoot up the heroin, and they are treated as poor unfortunates who got 'sucked into the cycle of abuse'. I'm calling BS in all that noise. You chose to get high. When you bonk, it's taxpayer funded EMS who comes to revive you, haul you to the ER, where time and funding are spent on a condition that is self induced, in most cases. These are just two areas that contribute to lower life expectancy in the US, and the trends aren't looking good."", 'It’s going to get so much worse s/p pandemic.

I\'ve kept at it, I\'m down to 185, and I haven\'t taken any insulin in five years. \n\nBefore, my insulin was C$85 for five vials, which last me about two weeks, plus I had to prick my fingers at least four times a day for blood tests, and each test strip was C$0.75.

Everyone is familiar with life expectancy in the past right? People who survived childhood often lived into their 60s and '70s, but overall life expectancy was significantly lower because infant mortality was so high.\n\nWell Even our modern statistics fall victim to the same sort of statistical stumbling block, in that infant mortality is not captured uniformly across countries. The United States is one of the few countries that counts every single newborn that takes at least one breath as living. Other countries don't do this. Some wait for an infant to reach several months of age before it even becomes part of their statistical body. This leads to the United States having higher infant mortality than comparable socioeconomic nations, and impacts our overall life expectancy stat as well.\n\nAnd you also have the issue of countries reporting these sorts of statistics accurately. Does anyone really believe that Cuba or Venezuela or Russia tell the truth when they're reporting their infant mortality?\n\nThe United States also has a significantly higher percentage of black people than our industrialized peer countries that we are often compared to.

Federal spending on Medicare is projected to be 18% of US GDP in the next 10 years, and that primarily just provides health coverage only for people over 67 years old (although, to be fair, elderly people tend to require the most healthcare) — but imagine what it would cost to expand Medicare to *every* age bracket. Sure, you could argue that economies of scale and better cost negotiations would kick-in and help with the overall cost, but it would still cost a lot.\n\nAt the end of the day though, you still have to overcome the Political/Cultural part of the equation: Americans tend to be biased towards retaining the ability to *choose* when to spend money on healthcare, even if it costs them significantly more, rather than have the Government take money out of their paychecks via Taxes to pay for healthcare whether they want it or not.

The cost of providing healthcare to *every* age group could easily exceed 35% of US GDP. That's *a lot* of money that Politicians would have to go on the record as voting to spend all at once.\n\nRationally though, such a system wouldn't really be Government spending a fuck ton more money, but rather Government just better redistributing the money people already spend on private Healthcare. Instead of people paying insurance premiums, deductibles, copays, etc. they'd just pay some amount of that to the Government in the form of a new tax and the Govt. would efficiently redistribute that money to pay for healthcare coverage for everyone all at once. However, if there are two things Americans vehemently disagree about it's taxes and centralized bureaucracy. There are a lot of Americans who would prefer to spend more money on healthcare when they *choose* to, rather than have the Govt. take more money out of their paychecks to pay for Healthcare whether they want it or not. And there are a lot of Americans who are convinced that Govt. is wasteful and inefficient and so they believe that if the Govt. takes over healthcare spending it will inevitably result in worse healthcare at a higher cost over the status quo.
