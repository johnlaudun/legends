Every medical professional should know this.

Less than 1% of our nations doctors answered the call, pre-hospitalization.  Because Fauci and big pharma closed off the dollars.  The vaccine billions required no effective treatments.  Fauci, Gates, and Pfizer could not risk anyone showing success with any early treatment.  Somehow lots of studies were funded to take down every promising treatment and create confusion.  Some have the appearances of good studies (of course they would never study using both zinc and hydroxychloroquine and some were shams.  The famous retracted Lancet study invented numbers out of thin air, but even after it was retracted politicians still used it to justify their actions.  The British Medical journal published a study using too much hydroxychloroquine used to create lots of adverse effects; the drug has been used safely for decades; those researchers should be jailed for violating the Nuremberg code.

But what I am seeing is people that are taking it alone, by itself, it's not having efficacy. What we're finding clinically with outpatients is that it really only works in conjunction with zinc. So the hydroxychloroquine opens a zinc channel, the zinc goes into the cell, it then blocks the replication of [the virus].”\n",

I'm certain it was MCAS that caused my full-term stillbirth 6 years ago and the flares have only gotten worse. We found out we had black mold in the house, a major trigger, and now that it's gone I'm hopeful I'll continue to improve, but I know it's something I'll probably struggle with for the rest of my life.\n",
      "Low histamine can be sustainable. It beats the alternative, eating anything and feeling like crap. Not every high histamine food will be a trigger. It's different for everyone. Taking a DAO supplement before eating will help break down the histamine in foods. Some people find relief doing carnivore. Taking grass-fed beef thymus and kidney (DAO), along with a low histamine probiotic before eating helps cut down the reactions. Cromolyn sodium helped a lot until I had bad side effects. Ketotifen helps, but I have to get it overseas because they don't make it in pill form in the US. Quercetin, vitamin C, and a bunch of other supplements help. There are other meds that can be used including prednisone, benzodiazepines, Xolair, Singulair, Zafirlukast, LDN, etc. Removing triggers is important. Mold can be a huge trigger. We've spent thousands of dollars getting our home rid of it. It's helped a great deal. Keeping a clean diet and avoiding trigger foods helps tremendously. Getting enough sleep is also important. All these things are helping me heal. It's been a long 2 years, but I'm finally starting to feel better. Getting the mold out of the house and avoiding triggers has been key for me.\n",
