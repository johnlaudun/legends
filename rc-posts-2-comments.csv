His plea deal called for no prison time, a stay of adjudication and the dismissal of two out of three charges. If Shei completes his probation, all charges against him will be dismissed and will not be on his criminal record.\n\nShei was 15 and 16 years old at the time of the sexual assaults and he was initially charged in juvenile court in 2019. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, his case was pushed back to the point that prosecutors would soon lose jurisdictional authority to prosecute the case.\nCharges were dismissed against Shei in those cases but were soon refiled. Shei was then given a plea deal that included his stay of adjudication and no prison time in exchange for him not challenging certification in adult court, which allowed for his continued prosecution, according to Olmsted County Senior Attorney Thomas Gort.\nShei entered an Alford plea in December 2022, meaning that while he does not admit guilt, he admits that a jury would convict him based on the evidence.""\n\nThis is indeed what a broken system looks like- HOWEVER if you really read carefully what he was actually given was a potential death sentence- there is no way he is going to complete 30 years of probation without violation SO this will go on his record, he will be a sex offender and will likely (i would say 100% certainly) end up in jail as a sex offender- where HOPEFULLY he will be marked for death (this is true of U.S. prisons... for the most part)\n\nThe judge and prosecutor and I would argue his lawyer all know all of this and are playing the long game on him.', 'I agree,SA penalties should be much much higher.\n\nBut if you wanted to be fair and not a biased jackass, maybe find one of the numerous middle aged white guys that got a similarly light sentence instead of  the token black rapist you conveniently found.', 'And people here are defending this?

Whats supposed to have happened there?\n\nHere\'s what ChatGPT gave me when I asked it:\n\nNorth Fox Island, located in Lake Michigan, gained notoriety due to its association with a disturbing child exploitation case that unfolded in the 1970s. The island itself is a privately owned property and was once owned by Francis Shelden, a wealthy businessman.\n\nIn the early 1970s, Shelden used the island as a base for his child pornography and child exploitation activities. He lured young boys, mostly from troubled backgrounds, to the island under the guise of a summer camp called the ""Brother Paul\'s Children\'s Mission."" Shelden would invite these boys to the island and subject them to various forms of sexual abuse, which he filmed for distribution to a network of pedophiles.\n\nThe illicit activities on North Fox Island were eventually exposed in 1975 when one of Shelden\'s victims, a 14-year-old boy named Douglas Wabeke, managed to escape and report his ordeal to the authorities. The subsequent investigation uncovered a network of child exploitation that extended beyond the island.\n\nAs the investigation progressed, it became apparent that Shelden had powerful connections and was involved in international child trafficking. However, before he could be brought to justice, Shelden disappeared. In 1977, his abandoned boat was found off the coast of France, but his fate remains unknown.\n\nThe case surrounding North Fox Island and Francis Shelden shed light on the issue of child exploitation and the existence of organized networks involved in such crimes. It also highlighted the challenges faced by law enforcement in investigating and dismantling these networks.\n\nIt\'s important to note that the events and details described above are based on historical records and media reports up until my knowledge cutoff in September 2021.', ""Almost all the information in the world, though quite censored, is available online.

Long ago I heard from an ex gf how her sister was a model inside some rich guy’s yacht and she was gone for months at the time and when she turned 19 she came back home loaded with a couple of millions and she absolutely refused to tell how she got them, she got a house, a car and pay cash for her college (I knew her sister too by the way), one time when she got drunk she told us the rich guy was a middle eastern guy who had around 8 young girls in that yacht and he would pick them to spent the night or be with guest in international waters.

Similar to 18F-FDG, radiopharmaceutical uptake in reactive lymph nodes has been already widely described with PET using radiolabelled choline [25] or somatostatin analogues [26].\n\n>\tMoreover, increased 18F-FDG uptake in hypermetabolic lymph nodes due to vaccine-related immune response has been already described in several patients who underwent different types of vaccinations beyond those against COVID-19 [22], therefore this is not a significant novelty.\n\n>\tFurthermore, we should also take into account that a clear information about the prevalence of these PET findings in COVID-19 vaccine recipients cannot be obtained by using these case reports and small case series only, because these manuscripts are strongly affected by publication bias; in other words, positive results (presence of increased radiopharmaceutical uptake at PET with different radiotracers after vaccination) are more likely to be published compared to negative findings (absence of increased radiopharmaceutical uptake at PET with different radiotracers after vaccination).', '>\tDuring the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic several 2-[18F]FDG PET/CT imaging findings associated with COVID-19 were described [19,20,21]. Further 2-[18F]FDG PET/CT findings were described after the introduction of COVID-19 vaccines [5,6,9], in particular HALNs ipsilateral to the vaccine injection site. Our systematic review and meta-analysis clearly demonstrates that this 2-[18F]FDG PET/CT finding is frequent after recent COVID-19 vaccination and it is due to immune response to the vaccine in most of the cases [10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18]. Recognition of the vaccine-related HALNs may avoid patient anxiety and unnecessary further examinations or biopsies. These results seem to be in line with those of previous studies reporting a significant prevalence of HALNs after recent vaccinations beyond those related to COVID-19 (Table 4) [22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29].\n\n>The high frequency of HALNs at 2-[18F]FDG PET/CT after recent COVID-19 vaccination could be explained by the high sensitivity of this imaging method for detection of inflammatory abnormalities and immune response including reactive lymph nodes; cells involved in inflammation and immune response are able to take up 2-[18F]FDG due to their expression of high levels of glucose transporters and high hexokinase activity [7].\n\n>\tHALNs at 2-[18F]FDG PET/CT after recent COVID-19 vaccination were not enlarged in the majority of cases. This is not surprising as functional/metabolic abnormalities detected by 2-[18F]FDG PET usually precede morphological abnormalities detected by CT scan and other conventional imaging methods [7]. Furthermore, the pooled prevalence of HALNs detected by 2-[18F]FDG PET/CT was higher than the prevalence of axillary lymphadenopathies (short axis >10 mm) detected by conventional imaging techniques after COVID-19 vaccinations [5,6,9].\n\n>There is a trend towards a higher prevalence of HALNs at 2-[18F]FDG PET/CT after the second vaccine dose compared to the first dose; this finding can be explained by the boost reactivation after the second vaccine injection [10,11,12,13].\n\n>Notably, hypermetabolic lymph nodes at 2-[18F]FDG PET/CT after COVID-19 vaccination may also be detected outside the axillary region [10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18].\n\n>HALNs are more frequent in immunocompetent than in immunocompromised patients and more frequent in young than in older patients (<64 years), therefore, immune competency and age may play a role in the prevalence of this finding [10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18].\n\n>Although the prevalence of HALNs decreases over time after COVID-19 vaccination, HALNs at 2-[18F]FDG PET/CT were even observed 10 weeks after COVID-19 vaccination [15]. COVID-19 vaccines seem to be more immunostimulatory as compared to other traditional vaccine agents [1,2], and this may account for their longer-lasting vaccine-related HALNs. However, more studies are needed to clarify the time required after COVID-19 vaccination to allow for resolution of HALNs.\n\n>Another frequent finding at 2-[18F]FDG PET/CT after COVID-19 vaccination is the presence of radiopharmaceutical uptake in the vaccine injection site (deltoid muscle). This finding in cases of concomitant ipsilateral HALNs at 2-[18F]FDG PET/CT might be useful for determining the vaccine-related nature of HALNs. Whereas HALNs might be a marker of vaccine-induced immune system activation, increasing over time and after the second vaccine dose, the increased metabolic activity in the vaccine injection site is inflammatory in nature, and likely secondary to local trauma [10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18].\n\n>Even if the majority of HALNs detected by 2-[18F]FDG PET/CT after COVID-19 vaccination are related to immune response after vaccine injection, in some patients with oncological diseases, to discriminate HALNs due to COVID-19 vaccination from malignancy, further examinations such as ultrasound and biopsies would be necessary, especially in patients with breast cancer, lymphoma, or melanoma [10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18]. Because there is an overlap in the intensity of 2-[18F]FDG uptake among benign and malignant HALNs, this parameter cannot be used to discriminate these two entities after COVID-19 vaccination; conversely, information about tumor type, disease history, and previous imaging are very useful for assessing the nature of HALNs detected by 2-[18F]FDG PET/CT after COVID-19 vaccination.\n\n>Based on the potential risk of HALNs after COVID-19 vaccine to mimic or mask malignant disease at 2-[18F]FDG PET/CT, patients with cancer with a propensity for spread to ipsilateral axillary lymph nodes (e.g., breast cancer, melanoma, and lymphomas) should have the COVID-19 vaccine in the contralateral arm to the tumor site. Nuclear medicine technologists or anyone collecting anamnestic data should document vaccine site, date, type, and first versus second dose. Overall, recent ipsilateral COVID-19 vaccination history should be recognized as a potential common cause of HALNs on PET/CT scans.', ""Continuing with your obvious projections I see\n\nI'm not the one who were accusing someone of being a shill\n\nYou were\n\nTry again"", 'Well a gun shot and comorbidities are very different things.

The Vaccine Safety Datalink Workgroup reported no association between hepatitis B vaccination at birth and febrile episodes or neurological adverse events. Other studies found positive associations between hepatitis B vaccination and ear infection,\npharyngitis, and chronic arthritis; as well as receipt of early intervention/special education services (EIS); in probability samples of U.S. children. Children with autistic spectrum disorder (ASD) comprise a growing caseload for EIS. We evaluated the association between hepatitis B vaccination of male neonates and\nparental report of ASD.\n\nMETHODS: This cross-sectional study used U.S. probability samples obtained from National Health Interview Survey 1997-2002 datasets. Logistic regression modeling was used to estimate the effect of neonatal hepatitis B vaccination on ASD risk among boys age 3-17 years with shot records, adjusted for race, maternal education, and two-parent household.\n\nRESULTS: **Boys who received the hepatitis B vaccine during the first month of life had 2.94 greater odds for ASD** (nZ31 of 7,486; OR Z 2.94; p Z 0.03; 95% CI Z 1.10, 7.90)\ncompared to later- or unvaccinated boys.Non-Hispanicwhite boys were 61% less likely to have ASD(ORZ0.39; pZ0.04; 95% CIZ0.16, 0.94) relative to non-white boys.\n\nCONCLUSION: Findings suggest that U.S. male neonates vaccinated with hepatitis B vaccine had a 3-fold greater risk of ASD; risk was greatest for non-white boys.', 'Kids are inoculated for too much too early.

Because pharma has absolutely 0 risk in producing a bad product due to their legal immunity, their quality control procedures are abhorrent. These scientists and researchers tested a ton of vaccines and found a litany of heavy metals in them that are massively toxic to the body and especially the brain.  \n\n**""Some metallic particles made of Tungsten or stainless steel were also identified. Other particles containing Zirconium, Hafnium, Strontium and Aluminum (Vivotif, Meningetec); Tungsten, Nickel, Iron (Priorix, Meningetec); Antimony (Menjugate kit); Chromium (Meningetec); Gold or Gold, Zinc (Infarix Hexa, Repevax), or Platinum, Silver, Bismuth, Iron, Chromium (MMRvaxPro) or Lead,Bismuth (Gardasil) or Cerium (Agrippal S1) were also found. The only Tungsten appears in 8/44 vaccines, while Chromium (alone or in alloy with Iron and Nickel) in 25/44. The investigations revealed that some particles are embedded in a biological substrate, probably proteins, endo-toxins and residues of bacteria. As soon as a particle comes in contact with proteic fluids, a nano-bio-interaction6 occurs and a ""protein corona"" is formed.7‒10 The nano-bio-interaction generates a bigger-sized compound that is not biodegradable and can induce adverse effects, since it is not recognized as self by the body.""**\n\n\nIt gets so much worse. \n\n\n**The quantity of foreign bodies detected and, in some cases, their unusual chemical compositions baffled us. The inorganic particles identified are neither biocompatible nor biodegradable, that means that they are biopersistent and can induce effects that can become evident either immediately close to injection time or after a certain time from administration. It is important to remember that particles (crystals and not molecules) are bodies foreign to the organism and they behave as such. More in particular, their toxicity is in some respects different from that of the chemical elements composing them, adding to that toxicity which, in any case, is still there, that typical of foreign bodies. For that reason, they induce an inflammatory reaction.**\n\n**After being injected, those microparticles, nanoparticles and aggregates can stay around the injection site forming swellings and granulomas.17 But they can also be carried by the blood circulation, escaping any attempt to guess what will be their final destination. We believe that in many cases they get distributed throughout the body without causing any visible reaction, but it is also likely that, in some circumstances, they reach some organ, none excluded and including the microbiota, in a fair quantity. As happens with all foreign bodies, particularly that small, they induce an inflammatory reaction that is chronic because most of those particles cannot be degraded. Furthermore, the protein-corona effect (due to a nano-bio-interaction18 can produce organic/inorganic composite particles capable of stimulating the immune system in an undesirable way.19‒22 It is impossible not to add that particles the size often observed in vaccines can enter cell nuclei and interact with the DNA**\n\n\nVaccines have caused an incomprehensible amount of disease, mental disorders, autoimmune conditions, cancers, everything.

Make people sick so their symptoms can be treated in perpetuity by the medical system where they can profit off your misery and suffering until you die, making both money and fulfilling their depopulation goal.

Regardless if you think they are effective or not at preventing X viral infection, the risk of getting a bad quality controlled batch filled with tungsten, strontium, nickel, or whatever other heavy metal FAR outweighs its supposed value.

A cellphone isn't meant to empower you towards escaping the matrix (even though it's useful in disseminating relevant info): it's meant to make you ***depend*** on it (the cellphone itself). \n\nThe way out is within. Look up Tesla. Reich. Viktor Schauberger. You don't need a cellphone once you are one with the ether which is a matter of course if you're wearing a human body."", 'Go further and deeper.  That old low voltage tech was actually perfected and super-reliable.  They\'d had almost a hundred years of it.\n\nYou\'d lose electricity to wherever you were, and you may even lose things like your water flow if it\'s on an electric pump.  But, you pick up that old landline and you\'d get a dial tone.\n\nI\'ve been diving into the push to convert to wireless, along with the legislators that have fought the local phone companies about reductions of landline service.  Something\'s up.\n\nThe push began in the very late 1990s, right about the time we were racing towards GHW Bush\'s ""A New World Order"" agenda that was getting rolling under KillBill and then GHWB Jr..  Pay phones started to disappear first.  Then, the phone companies stopped their long term plans of hardening their target even further by stopping the burying of lines underground projects.  Leaving the above ground systems more susceptible to failures by natural and man-made reasons, and, personally, I think to continue to make it easier for ""tapping"".\n\nHere\'s the rub.  You couldn\'t easily track landline use to a user.  If you wanted anonymity, you went to a pay phone in a public place.  Inside any location, anyone at all could pick up the phone, hard to say it was one particular person that placed the call.\n\nIf you wanted to push towards a surveillance state, the landline was in the way.  It heightened the arduous process of surveilling someone.  If the person was being followed and went to a pay phone, and began a conversation, the follower had to figure out what phone number was being used, and technology was a delay to intercept the conversation.  if the caller stayed on the phone for less than about a minute and a half, the conversation couldn\'t be easily captured.\n\nThat is, until ECHELON came into being in the 1960s.  BUT, there were still a lot of glitches in using it in the manner of it\'s intent.  Calls slipped through the cracks, as the computing power to capture wasn\'t big enough.\n\nEarly cellphone technology was analog based, rather than digital.  It was remarkably easier to track based on triangulation vs. the landline, and, due to the expense of the calls, clear documentation by the carrier of the history of the calls made (maybe because they used to be about a buck a minute, and tons of folks used to dispute their cell bills), as they worked to perfect their technology.\n\nThen, along came digital wireless technology.  Their job has been easy as hell to keep tabs on folks ever since.\n\nI think OP\'s position may have some validity, as it would be the ends to the means of the historical diatribe I\'ve vomited onto this page.\n\nSave the landline, save yourself.', ""How does cell phones help us escape our prison matrix that landlines cannot do?
