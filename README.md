Hello there! This repository includes all the code and some of the notes for a paper I am giving at the annual meeting of the International Society for Contemporary Legend Research. 

The files included here are largely Jupyter notebooks where the work got done and CSV files where outputs got saved and/or loaded. There is also a PDF version of the presentation, and, time permitting, a markdown version of the essay. 

If you have any questions, please feel free to submit an issue: GH will notify me.
